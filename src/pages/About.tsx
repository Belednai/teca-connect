                    The Twic East Community Association (TECA) was born from a shared vision of hope, 
                    unity, and sustainable development. Established by members of the Twic East community 
                    living in Juba, TECA represents the collective aspirations of families who dream 
                    of returning to their ancestral lands with dignity and opportunity.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Our journey began with simple community meetings where elders, youth, women, and 
                    men gathered to discuss the challenges and opportunities of resettlement. What 
                    emerged was a clear consensus: any return to Twic East must be voluntary, 
                    well-planned, and built on solid foundations that ensure long-term success.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Today, TECA serves as the bridge between aspiration and reality, coordinating 
                    comprehensive development programs across six payams: Ajuong, Kongor, Lith, 
                    Nyuak, Pakeer, and Pawuoi. Each payam has unique needs and priorities, but all 
                    share the common goal of creating sustainable, thriving communities.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    We believe that true development comes from within the community itself. Every 
                    project we undertake is guided by community input, managed with full transparency, 
                    and designed to build local capacity. Our approach ensures that the infrastructure 
                    we build today will serve generations to come.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    TECA is more than an organizationâ€”we are a movement of hope, a testament to what 
                    can be achieved when communities unite around shared values and common purpose. 
                    Together, we are not just building schools, wells, and roads; we are building 
                    the foundation for a brighter future.
